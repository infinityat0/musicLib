musicLib - I can haz no duplicatez!

- This came out of frustration of having duplicates in iTunes
library and hearing the same song repeate twice and thrice before switching to a new one.
- This is a simple program that picks up an export of iTunes Library and removes all duplicates (wipes the duplicate files off the Hard Drive)
- It keeps the files that have higher bit rate so the ones that you end up having are the ones that sound best!
